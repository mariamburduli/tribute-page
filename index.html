        <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
            the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
            in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I
            saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
            Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
            laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
            returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
            breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
            Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab
            to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,
            and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
            Pathology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
            leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
            plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
            6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
            different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1914</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
            season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="singh">
          "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
          contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
          scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
